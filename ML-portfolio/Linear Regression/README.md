# Linear Regression
This repository contains a Python program that demonstrates the implementation of linear regression using the scikit-learn library. The program focuses on predicting the final grade (G3) of students based on various attributes. It provides an introduction to machine learning concepts, particularly linear regression, and showcases the usage of relevant libraries.

## Libraries
The program utilizes the following Python libraries:

- Numpy - Used for making arrays
- Pandas - Used for handling data sets
- matplotlib - Used for making charts and graphs
- scikit-learn intro - Used to handle complex mathematics
- scikit-learn tut - In depth discussion
- pickle - Used to preserve trained models
~~~
# Library Imports
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import sklearn
import matplotlib.pyplot as pyplot
import pickle
from sklearn import linear_model
from sklearn.utils import shuffle
from matplotlib import style
~~~
## features
The program applies linear regression using Python and scikit-learn to predict students' final grades based on selected attributes from a dataset, encompassing data loading, preprocessing, model creation, training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Configuration and Usage
This program does not need any aditional Configuration, aslong as all of the required libraries are installed correctly. As a result of this, all you need in order to use the program is your own data set.
