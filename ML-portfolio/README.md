# Machine Learning Portfolio
This portfolio contains a number of projects that all relate to various supervised and unsupervised methods of machine learning. For each project, they have their own README.md that goes into more details about the libraries used, as well as config and usages. Also in this portfolio, you will find an essay on ethics and privacy in the age of AI, which is formatted as a .txt file.

## Libraries
Across all of the projects there are a number of python libraries used, however here are some of the more common ones used. If you want a more in depth list of all libraries, look at the README.md that each project contains.

- Numpy - Used for making arrays
- Pandas - Used for handling data sets
- matplotlib - Used for making charts and graphs
- scikit-learn intro - Used to handle complex mathematics
- scikit-learn tut - In depth discussion
- pickle - Used to preserve trained models

## features
Each program contains its own usage and features, however all of them aim to manipulate data in some way in order to train a machine learning model on said datasets, apart from the essay, which is for your reading pleasure.

## Configuration and Usage
Most programs do not need any additional configuration, as they already have their own sets of data to work off of.
